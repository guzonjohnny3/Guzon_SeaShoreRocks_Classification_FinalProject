📘 Project Description:
This project classifies different types of sea shore rocks using a Teachable Machine image model. 
The model was trained with multiple image samples per rock type to identify and predict categories 
based on visual features such as color, shape, and texture.

----------------------------------------------
🧠 Features:
- Uses Google Teachable Machine for image recognition
- Supports multiple rock categories
- Displays model accuracy and confusion matrix results
- Easy-to-use interface for testing new images

----------------------------------------------
⚙️ Tools Used:
- Teachable Machine (Image Project)
- Python / TensorFlow (for evaluation)
- GitHub for project hosting

----------------------------------------------
📸 Model Information:
- Dataset: Collected images of sea shore rocks
- Training Samples: 250+ per class
- Model Type: Standard Image Classification
